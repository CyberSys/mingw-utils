mingw-utils-0.4 is a maintainance release, which 
simply incorporates msys-here and ensures that it
builds without error. However, msys-here appears
to be broken -- so...fix the actual operation.

Right now, msys-here is an odd mix of restricted
behavior selection (rxvt or sh, normal msys or msys-dvlpr --
but can't use bash explicitly, or console2), some that
can be selected by command-line option, hardcoded defaults
(sh will always be invoked as a login shell, rxvt will always
be invoked with -sl 2500 and Courier-12 font, etc), and .ini
file customizations (console colors).
This makes no sense. Fix it.
