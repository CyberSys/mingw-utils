This is mingw-utils, a collection of utilities (hopefully)
useful for MinGW and MSYS installations. It contains:

  redir     A utility for redirecting stderr within dain bramaged CMD boxes
  reimp     Converts certain MS-format import libraries to GNU format
  res2coff  Converts .res resource files to .o object format [*]
  a2dll     Create a DLL from a static archive [**]
  dsw2mak   Create gcc-compatible GNU makefiles from Visual Studio 6,0 workspaces
  msys-here Launch an msys window from a Windows Explorer context menu

[*] possibly obsoleted by modern incarnations of windres

The following were once provided by older versions of mingw-utils,
but are now provided by other packages or sites.

  drmingw   A JIT exception handler for Windows that can display debugging info.
            Now provided by http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/DrMingw
  dos2unix  Converts line endings. Superseded by cygutils-dos2unix package
  unix2dos  Ditto
  pexports  Create .def file listing symbols from DLLS. Now provided separately.



Compiling
=========
To build mingw-utils from source, you need only do the standard
   $ configure
   $ make
   $ make install

However, the following configure arguments are recommended:
   $ configure --prefix=`cd /mingw && pwd -W` \
               --docdir=\${prefix}/share/doc/mingw-utils/0.4 \
               --enable-subproject-docdir
   $ make

To install into a temporary staging directory, do not use DESTDIR.
Instead, override prefix as follows:
   $ make install prefix=/tmp/mingw-utils-staging

Alternatively, instead of manually creating a "staging"
tree, after a successful build, you can use the following
rules to create MinGW-standard installation packages:

	$ make sdist bdist
