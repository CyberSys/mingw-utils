1. About this software:
	MSYS Here is a loader for an MSYS environment. It is a bit
	of an anomaly, because it is "msys"-related, but is itself
	a purely native, win32 application. Also, as an integrated
	component of the 'mingw-utils' suite, it is typically and
	by default installed into the /mingw/bin (that is, C:\MinGW\bin)
	directory, rather than into the regular /bin (that is,
	C:\msys\1.0\bin) directory like most msys-related applications.
	
2. Installation:
	Standard configure && make && make install. However, to
	create a "staging" tree suitable for creating a binary
	package that satisfies the MinGW Packaging Standard, it
	is recommended that the msys-here project be configured
	and compiled as part of the overall 'mingw-utils' project.

	In that case, the following options are recommended (to
	be performed in the mingw-utils directory, not here in the
	mingw-utils/msys-here directory.

	$ configure --prefix=`cd /mingw && pwd -W` \
		--docdir=\${prefix}/share/doc/mingw-utils/0.4 \
		--enable-subproject-docdir
	$ make
	$ make install prefix=/tmp/mingw-utils-0.2

	Alternatively, instead of manually creating a "staging"
	tree, after a successful build, you can use the following
	rules (again, from the parent mingw-utils directory):

	$ make sdist bdist

3. Configuration:
	From an msys shell, run
	$ msys-here-config

	Use -h to see the various options controlling whether
	to install msys-here as an Explorer context menu item
	for only the current user, for all users, and other features.
	To install for all users, you may need to run msys-here-config
	as an Administrator.

	msys-here-config can also be used to remove msys-here from
	your system.
